### Problem 1
Playing With Beads   
There are N people in a group labeled from 1 to N. People are connected to each other via threads in the following manner:    
The person with label number K is connected to all the persons with label J such that exactly divides K. Beads can be passed through the threads. If a person P has a bead, in how many ways can the bead be passed in the network of threads so that it returns to the same person within X moves or less?
MOVE: Passing the bead from one person to the other.   

Input Specification:   
Input1: N, denoting the number of people.   
Input2: P, label of the person having the bead.   
Input3: X, maximum number of moves that can be made.
